# Monkeys_paw_poem
A digital poem created from The Monkey's Paw by W.W. Jacobs.

The Monkey's Paw is a story about a mystical cursed object. From that, my mind went to magic spells, which are often almost english but not quite. I tried to replicate how some old magic scrolls are written in blocks of text with no gaps on the sides, which has always been aethstetically pleasing to me. The poem is meant more to be looked at than read, but parts of it may be pronouncable or be reminiscient of english.
